Sample Knowledge Base

This is a sample document for testing the RAG application.

Topic 1: Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines designed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can perform tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Topic 2: Machine Learning  
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Topic 3: Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines including computer science and computational linguistics.

Topic 4: Computer Vision
Computer Vision is a field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects.

Topic 5: Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain to learn from large amounts of data.

This document contains information about various AI topics that can be queried through the RAG system. The system will retrieve relevant chunks and generate appropriate responses based on this knowledge base.
